# MobilePhone
I designed a two sims mobile phone with html and Javascrip
Just hold press the power on button and at the back of the phone, be counting the time until it is 3secs, release the button and the piaaam! The mobile phone is on
use finger print, the circle like on the button side of the phone to unlock it....
